# Notes on usage:

# Call the method readServers() with the two files as parameters
# HOSTS.csv and ag_list.csv, in that order.

# The method returns a dictionary.
# The dictionary has a key (IP Address) and value (Department names).

# The dictionary will return a tuple of a variable number of elements. 
# Iterate through it to get each department to which an IP belongs.
# (I figured out how to make it work with Tuples of length 1, so don't worry
# about what I said the other day with strings)
